This is my attempt at the Rock Paper Scissors assignment that The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) assigns as part of its learning curriculum.

To run, somply run "web.html" in your browser. 

If it fails to launch, right-click anywhere in the page, and left-click "Inspect". 
Next, left-click the "Sources" tab, right-click "web.html", then left-click "Open in Containing Folder". 
finally, move "game.js" into the folder and refresh.
